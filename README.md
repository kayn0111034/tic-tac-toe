# tic-tac-toe

This is a tic tac toe game developed in Java.
It utilizes Java Swing to create a GUI for players to use and play on.

## Java files in src
1. main.java
2. ticTacToe.java
3. TicTacToeRemake.java

main does not work currently
ticTacToe was a version with many redundant code and not in use.
TicTacToeRemake is the version that you should use. The code is a lot more optimized than in ticTacToe and works efficiently.
